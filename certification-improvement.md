<h1>Suggestions to Improve Qubes Certification</h1>

<h2>Why does Qubes Certification exist/What are the aims?</h2>

- **Increase the number of Qubes Users**
- **Provide a trusted, standardised, 'guarantee' for the security of certified hardware**
- **Raise revenue for the Qubes Project**

<h2>How does it achieve the aims?</h2>

- **Providing manufacturers added value**
- Certification leads to more sales
- Adopting qubes certification increases trust in not only the product, but the company too

<h2>Succesful certification program is a positive cycle of growth</h2>

- More certified products = greater revenue & more users
- More users = increased incentive for manufacturers to certify = more certified products

A certified product is worth more than those whom purchase one and install Qubes. Every certified product becomes free advertising space for Qubes, raising project awareness which will of-course lead to more users - further increasing the incentive to certify products.



<h2>Suggestions for Improvement</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

I am aware that some of what is written here may already be the case behind closed doors. However, the lack of public information available to manufacturers means the certification program is not very approachable. I am not alleging that the Qubes team are going to charge $10,000 for a manufacturer to add a new wifi-card, but what guarantee is there to the manufacturer this will not be the case? Clearly defining the unknowns makes the program much more approachable to manufacturers and reduces the work for the Qubes Team. I understand time is a limited resource, so I have attempted to save some time by providing suggestions I think would make the program much more approachable to manufacturers.  

<h3>Aims</h3>

Reformation of the Certification program to achieve the following aims:  
- **Reduced work for the Qubes Team**  
- **Resolve concerns of Manufacturers & Increase Number of Certified Products**:
- Reduce work to attain certification for manufacturers
- Enable manufacturers to attain certification for multiple 'configurations' without futher costs and with minimal extra work



<h3>Proposed Implementation</h3>

Split the certification program into the following tiers:  
'Qubes x Ready'  
'Qubes Bronze Certified'  
'Qubes Gold Certified'

^^**The Specified Product**:  
(The specified product will be specifically defined for each contract. Please note: we want to ensure manufacturers are able to offer different configurations for the same product whilst ensuring the requirements are transferred across configurations. It is for this reason that the precise scope of each product will be defined for each valid certification as we need to be sure that the certification requirements can continue to be met within the given scope - it is not possible to offer certification to a 'model' of a product if some of the configurable components contained are not compatible. In addition to defining the certification product configuration(s), we have done alot of work to make it minimal effort to extend a products certification to accommodate new components).
