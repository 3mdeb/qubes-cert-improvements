<h1>Qubes Certification Scheme Versioning Info</h1>


Each Qubes Certification has a versioning scheme, this enables updates to each respective certification.  

When you become Qubes Gold (for example) certified, you are conforming to the latest version of the Qubes Gold Certified Specification.  
Each certification - e.g.: Qubes Gold is trademarked. When you certify a product, you gain the rights to use the Certification Trademark for that product (according to the T&Cs), regardless of any certification specification updates.
