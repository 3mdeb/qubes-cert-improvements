<h2>T&Cs</h2> 

This certification is valid only for the specified product. [Please read below^^]()  
You are comitting to supporting the latest Qubes Release for the specified product:  
for as the specified product remains on sale,  
and in addition   
for the entire warranty period of any products sold.  
The manufacturer must **offer for sale** the Specified Product in-line with the Minimum Product Offer for no less than 2 years from, (whichever comes last):  
the date of certification  
OR  
the date of first sale   

**offer for sale**:  
For the period defined, during this period there must be no interruption in the offer of sale

**The Specified Product**:  
The specified product encompasses all the certified configurations of the product.  
The specified product is subject to change, at the agreement of both parties, on the following terms:  
Additional certified configurations can be added during the duration of the contract, subject to approval and defined costs.  
Defined costs:  
(xxx)  

**Minimum product offer**:  
To enable the manufacturer to withdraw (and possibly add) certain configurations, (as components become deprecated), the Minimum Product Offer defines the abstract specification for certified configurations that must be continually offered on sale.  
(e.g: A certified configuration containing a wifi card, webcam, etc, must be offered.)

**Certified Configurations**  
Cetified configurations enable the manufacturer to offer different components within the same certified product. One product can have many certified configurations. Each certified configuration will specify whether the defined element is mandatory (meaning it must be contained) or optional (meaning it can be optionally offered) - e.g:  
Element - Intel CPU x - mandatory  
Element - Intel wifi card x - optional  
The above would mean the product could be sold provided Intel CPU x is included, and Intel wifi card x is offered.  
All elements must be certified for the configuration on sale to be certified. This means, as per above example, if Intel wifi card x is certified as optional - but no other wifi card is certified as optional, then the manufacturer cannot offer Intel wifi card y and claim the product is certified. Nor can the manufactuer offer a webcam, for example, if there is no certified webcam element.
