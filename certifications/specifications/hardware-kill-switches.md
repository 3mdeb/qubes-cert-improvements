<h2>Hardware Kill Switch Spec</h2>

The kill switch must cut-off all power* to the component.  
It must not ask any other controller to do this, or ask the device to shut-itself off - it must directly cutoff the power.  

*This means all power sources. It is not acceptable, for example, to cutoff the mains-power only to the webcam if the webcam has an on-board battery.
