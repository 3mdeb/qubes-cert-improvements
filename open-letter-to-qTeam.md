**Dear Qubes Team**;  

Here are my suggestions to improve the Qubes Certification program.  
This is a complicated matter, so I have attempted to make things clear by splitting up the relevant components into this repo.  

I understand that much here may already be done by the Qubes-team behind closed doors.  
My intention is not to duplicate anything, rather to save-time to Qubes Team by systemising Certification and attracting more manufacturers by making it easier to obtain Certification; of-course, whilst maintaining trust in certification and without compromising on standards.  

Again, I understand this aim is not-trivial as there are many elements to consider - hence the repo.  
I truly believe these suggestions will bring better products, more users & more revenue to Qubes.  

If it is not my business to make such recommendations, please let me know.  
I value any feedback you have.  

**Best Regards;  
rootNoob**.
